# Title
DE101 Bootcamp- Code Review Week 12

# Name
Nikisha Banks

# Technologies Used: 
Git hub, Visual Studio Code, Airflow, Docker

# Languages and tools used: 
DAG Python and Bash Operators

# Description:
In this project, Airflow was used to orchestrate a workflow that did the following:
  1.Create a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) that uses a file sensor to check if a file has been uploaded to a folder named "data"
  2.Create a task that reads each row in the file and checks to see if the values in each row match values in a given list. If there is a match, the task adds the item to a new list
  3.Create a task that uses a Python function that takes the new list as an argument and prints the item that has the most occurrences  

# Setup/Installation Requirements:
- To see the code files in this project:
  1. Clone the repo in Git Hub: 
                a. Click the green "code" button
                b. Under the "Local" tab, copy and paste the URL that is under HTTPS
- Set up Airflow 
  1. In your visual studio terminal of your choice, create and activate a virtual environment in your repository folder by typing the following commands: 
     1. python3.10 -m venv <virtual environment name>
     2. source <virtual environment name>/bin/activate 
  2. Run the setup.sh file by typing ./setup.sh. This scripts sets up your environment and installs the necessary components
  3. Create the following new directories in the same folder:
     1. ./logs
     2. ./plugins
     3. ./dags
  4. Pull down the latest version of Airflow by typing 	"curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/docker-compose.yaml'"
  5. Create a Airflow user id by typing "echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)\nAIRFLOW_GID=0" > .env"
  6. Start Airflow and all related containers by typing:
     1. docker-compose up airflow-init
     2. docker-compose up
  7. Leave that terminal running and then open a new terminal to continue working in
  8. In your browser, go to localhost:8080, this will take you to the Airflow Graphical User Interface
- Shutting down Airflow and docker
  1. Switch to the terminal that is running your Airflow commands
  2. Either press CTRL + C or type "docker compose down"
  3. Type "docker system prune --volumes" to remove all volumes from the docker container
  4. type "docker volume list" to confirm that there are no volumes

## DAG 
The DAG Diagram in this project shows the order of tasks and their dependencies, if any
  1. The flow starts with the 'echo_to_file' task, this task is a Bash Operator that creates a text file that writes a name
  2. The second task is the 'greeting_task', this task is a Python Operator task that calls the function 'print_hello' and reads the file created by the first task and prints a greeting of "hello" along with the name in the file
  3. The third thru fifth tasks are Python Operator tasks that calls the function 'random_apples' and returns a random apple chosen from a list called 'apples'
  4. The last task ends the DAG

## DAG Final Outcome
As shown in the image the 'echo_to_file' task was successful on every run. The remainder of the tasks failed on 3 out of 4 runs, this was due to the functions having an incorrect parameter listed. This was corrected by leaving the parenthesis empty.

## Apple Selections
The following three visuals are snapshots from the log files after the random apple picking tasks were completed. The random apple that was chosen is highlighted.
